            <p>
                And welcome to my website!</p>
            <div>
                <img src="img/250x300px.png" alt="Myself in Greece" style="float: right; margin-left: 15px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 30px;">
                <p>
                    I'm Valentin, a mechanical engineer who, during an intership mid-way through college, found his calling in embedded programming.
                <p>
                    A few years later, after having completed my studies and landed my first job as a test engineer in a biotech company in France, I decided to go all in and follow my true passion for programming. Therefore, in February 2023, I bid farewell to gears and levers, and went on diving into the world of embedded systems.</p>
                <p>
                    On this website, you will find a showcase of my latest embedded projects. You might be wondering why I decided to work on those projects in particular. What's their purpose, and what am I trying to achieve with them?</p>
                <p>
                    As I believe practice is the best way to acquire, build and solidify knowledge, I've split my self-taught journey in a 30% course / 70% practical project distribution. Actually, many of the courses I've taken - such as CS50x - have a heavy hands-on component, so the ratio leans even more towards practice.</p>
                <p>
                    Thanks to those courses and projects, I have learnt the industry's standard programming practices. I have worked with several protocols such as SPI, UART or Bluetooth Low Energy, and have written drivers for various peripherals, including a joystick, an LCD display and a camera.</p>
                <p>
                    I invite you to explore this website, and hope you will enjoy reading about the projects I've had so much fun working on. You can also find the codebase of those projects on my <a href="https://github.com/valentinbetbeze" target="_blank">GitHub</a>!</p>
                <p>
                    If you'd like to discuss collaboration opportunities or simply connect, please feel free to reach out to me at <b>valentin.betbeze@gmail.com</b>. Have a good day!</p>
                <p> 
                    ps: When I'm not coding or building some project, I love travelling, hiking or simply reading good old books... like The Lord of the Rings :D</p>

                <p>
                    Inspired from the universe of The Lord of the Rings, this platform game currently has 2 worlds the player can explore: the Shire and the Mines of Moria. 10 minutes of average game time can be expected for the first runs, accounting for a few deaths leading the player to start over. Although, with persistence, the 'fake ring' may be retrieved from the depth of the Moria...</p>
                <p>
                    Hardware-wise, the program is running on an ESP32 (the "console") and displays on an external 128x160 LCD screen at a steady 45 frames per second, with a 16-bit color depth. The player dynamically interacts with its character using a wireless gamepad (joystick + buttons) communicating with the console via Bluetooth LE. The game also allows music and various sounds to be played via a buzzer, the way some consoles of the 70's used to.</p>
                <p>
                    This project uses no external library (only the ESP-IDF API's) and has its own peripheral drivers and game engine. <a href="platform_game.html">Click here to know more about the technical details!</a></p>

                <p>
                    Started during the plentiful free-time period that was the COVID-19 2020 lockdown, this project is at the boundaries between my love for mechanical engineering and programming. The whole purpose behind the design and building of this robot was to get a first foot in the world of robotics, and learn the intriguing ways of controlling servo motors. Plus, having a desktop-sized robotic arm at your side can always make a good friend.</p>
                <p>
                    The robot, able to carry up to 1kg of payload, is made of 6 servo motors (cheap MG995 & SG90), 2 transmissions and no less than 44 PLA 3D-printed parts.</p>
                <p>
                    As one of my first embedded project, I based the 5-axis arm on the Teensy 4.0 board, using the Arduino framework, giving me a straightforward start. The firmware allows the user to control the effector of the robot using a cartesian coordinate system. The inverse kinematics algorithm within the firmware takes care of feeding the motors with the proper angular positions, as well as managing the dynamics of the system.</p>
                <p>
                    I have so much more to say, but this wouldn't be a "quick overview" anymore. Worry not, <a href="robotic_arm.html">I've explained all other exciting details right here!</a></p>
